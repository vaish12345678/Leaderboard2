 Note :- 
The backend is not deployed. The deployed frontend may appear static (e.g., "Add Member" and "Claim Points" may not function).
However, the full backend implementation is available in the GitHub repository, and the MongoDB database is functional.
The entire project runs correctly when tested locally.
